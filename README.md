# What is it?

RPIG generates random private IPs, for use with Vagrant VMs etc. to avoid
collisions with multiple projects etc.


# How to use it?

Get the `rpig.py` -file and run it.

```
python rpig.py
```

If you feel adventurous it has options (well, one in addition to showing help).

```
python rpig.py --help
```
